## Setup and Usage Guide
To get started with the Sparrow Framework in Eclipse, follow these step-by-step instructions:

### Prerequisites
- Eclipse IDE (2022-04 or later version)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

### Install Xtext Plugin
To work with Sparrow, you need to have the Xtext plugin installed in Eclipse. You can install it in one of two ways:

1. **Eclipse Marketplace**: Search for "Xtext" in the Eclipse Marketplace and follow the installation instructions.
2. **Direct Installation**: Configure your Eclipse installation to include DSL development tools. This will enable you to work with Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) like Sparrow.

### Import Sparrow Project
1. Open Eclipse and select `File` > `Import`.
2. Choose `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace` and click `Next`.
3. Browse to the location of your Sparrow project and follow the prompts to import it.

### Understanding the Project Structure
The main files of the Sparrow DSL project are located in the `org.xtext.example.sparrow` package. Here's a brief overview:

- `*.xtext` files: Define the syntax of the Sparrow DSL language.
- `*.xtend` files: Define the mapping rules between the Sparrow DSL language and other languages, such as Java or Solidity for smart contract generation.

### Running the Project
After importing the project, you can run Sparrow's integrated development environment (IDE) directly within Eclipse. This will allow you to:

- Write and test Sparrow DSL scripts.
- Generate smart contracts from your DSL scripts.
- Utilize the features of the Sparrow framework.

### Getting Started with Sparrow IDE
Once the project is running, you can start using the Sparrow IDE by:
1. Creating a new Sparrow DSL file or opening an existing one.
2. Writing your legal contract specifications in the DSL language.
3. Using the provided tools to generate and test smart contracts.

Need to install Xtext plug-in, which you can choose to install in the marketplace or directly install Eclipse as a dsl developer.
The main files of the DSL project are in org.xtext.example.sparrow files.
The xtext file is responsible for defining the syntax of the DSL language, and the xtend file is responsible for defining the mapping rules between the DSL language and other languages.
After running the project, you can get Sparrow's IDE.
For more detailed information about Sparrow's syntactic semantic design and mapping rules, you can learn about it from the article "Sparrow: An Expressive, Encapsulated, and Extensible Domain-Specific Language for Smart Legal Contracts".
