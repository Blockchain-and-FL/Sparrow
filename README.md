## Usage
run in Eclipse 2022-04 
Need to install Xtext plug-in, which you can choose to install in the marketplace or directly install Eclipse as a dsl developer.
The main files of the DSL project are in org.xtext.example.sparrow files.
The xtext file is responsible for defining the syntax of the DSL language, and the xtend file is responsible for defining the mapping rules between the DSL language and other languages.
After running the project, you can get Sparrow's IDE.
For more detailed information about Sparrow's syntactic semantic design and mapping rules, you can learn about it from the article "Sparrow: An Expressive, Encapsulated, and Extensible Domain-Specific Language for Smart Legal Contracts".
